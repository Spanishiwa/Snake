# Snake
ES6 Snake

An ES6 take on the classic browser game Snake. Compiled with Babel for backwards compatibility, I implement new ES6 class syntax alongside HTML5, CSS to render a colored background complete with white snake parts and red apples. Played at a blistering 80 ms movement speed. I utilize Webpack to conveniently output the Snake game assets into a production ready bundle. Hosted through Github's free gh-pages service: spanishiwa.github.io/Snake/
